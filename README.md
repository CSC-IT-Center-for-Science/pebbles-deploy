# Pebbles-ansible repository

A work in progress, but this will contain the ansible to *deploy* pebbles on a
remote host.

Currently it's just a copy of the playbook and roles used to deploy on the
localhost with install_pb.bash (not included here, see original repo).

Idea is that pebbles-bastion playbook (from elsewhere) will clone this
playbook to be run by devs.
